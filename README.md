# ica19
An Jupyter Notebook that displays the ICA19 CSaB Schedule

This Python 3 notebook reads in the ica_schedule.csv file and outputs CSaB Session details. It assumes that the notebook and csv file are in the same working directory.

The complete ICA19 schedule (and csv datafile) can be viewed [here](https://ica2019.abstractcentral.com/planner.jsp).
